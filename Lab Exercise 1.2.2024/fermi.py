## Game of Fermi Version 0.5
## Author: 
## Date: 1/2/2024
## The goal of the game is for the player to guess the digits in
## the three positions in the least number of tries.  For each guess,
## the player provides three digits for position 1, 2, and 3.
## The program replies with a hint consisting of Fermi, Pico, and Nano.
## If the digit guess for a given position is correct, then the reply is Fermi.
## If the digit guessed for a given position is in a different position, then
## the reply is Pico.  If the digit guessed for a given position does not match
## any of the three digits, then the reply is Nano.
