##Lab Exercise 1.3.2024 Problem 1
##Author: 
##This program simulates a form of Yahtzee.  It will run until the player
##gets to 1000 points.  The player rolls 5 dice and earns points according
##to the following table:
##    5 of kind = 50
##    4 of a kind = 25
##    3 of a kind = 10
##The program keeps track of the number of triples, quadruple, and
##quintuples are rolled.  The goal of the game is to earn 1000 points
##in as few rolls as possible
